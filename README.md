# HOL: Building AI-Powered Applications with Helidon and LangChain4J

In this hands-on lab, you will build an AI-powered chat assistant for a coffee shop using **Helidon** and **LangChain4J**. The assistant will understand natural language, provide menu recommendations, and guide users through the ordering process.

## What You'll Learn

- How to use **Helidon** and **LangChain4J** to build an **AI-powered assistant**.
- How to use **Helidon Inject** for dependency injection.
- How to create **embeddings** from structured data and store them in an **embeddings store**.
- How to **query the embeddings store** using natural language.
- What **ingestors** and **content providers** are, and how to implement them.
- How to **fine-tune** your AI assistant for better responses.
